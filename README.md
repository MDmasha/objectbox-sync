# ObjectBox Sync Examples

[Website][1] | [Developer documentation][2] | [Examples](#sync-examples)

This repository contains examples demonstrating ObjectBox Sync capabilities.

[ObjectBox Sync][1] synchronizes data between devices and servers.
It's an "offline-first" solution, meaning your app works even when the network doesn't.
Data is kept in sync automatically when the network is available.
Learn more on the [Sync website][1] and [developer documentation][2].

## Prerequisites

To run the examples, you need to have:

* Docker to run the ObjectBox Sync Server (see [sync-server.md](sync-server.md) for details).
* At least one of the client development platforms (e.g. Android SDK, Flutter SDK, Go SDK, xCode for Swift, etc.). 

## Sync Examples

The following examples demonstrating Sync capabilities are available in this repository (more to come):

1. [Task Manager App](/tasks): A simple task manager app that serves as a basic introduction to ObjectBox Sync.
